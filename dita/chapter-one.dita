    <shortdesc>The Ugly Duckling is born.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p dir="ltr">It was a bright summer morning, and Mother Duck sat proudly on her nest by the
            edge of the serene pond. She had been waiting what felt like forever for her eggs to
            hatch, and today was finally the day. </p>
        <p>One by one, the eggs cracked open, and out came the fluffy yellow ducklings, all chirping
            excitedly. But as the mother duck counted her babies, she noticed that one didnâ€™t quite
            look like the rest. This duckling was larger, with gray feathers and a long neck. </p>
        <p>Mother Duck loved all her ducklings equally, but her heart sank when she saw how the
            others quickly began to tease the strange-looking one.</p>
